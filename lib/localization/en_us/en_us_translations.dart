      "This app will help you keep track of your games and victories in them.\nYou can create simple competition forms to do this and even break them up into multiple stages.\nWe use simple table creation without complicated parameters for competition types such as leagues, playoffs, challenges and duels. You will also be able to create player and team profiles here, keep track of their stats and prizes, and randomize the turn order or team members.\n\nLearn more about competition types:\n\nLeague- Suitable for games where every player has to play everyone.\n\nPlayoff - great for tournaments and elimination stages.\n\nChallenge - good for tabletop or mass games where everyone plays for themselves in a common discipline. Also is good for duels games.\n\nFor challenging you can select the Unlimited option and then the tournament will consist of infinite stages in the selected discipline. This is necessary to avoid ending the tournament after each completed stage. For example, if you play several games in one and the same game and want to determine a winner also by the total number of played games.",
